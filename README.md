# DogClickCounter
This code creates a graphical user interface (GUI) where a custom image (in this case, "bark.gif") serves as a clickable element. 
Each time the image is clicked, the click counter updates and displays the current count at the bottom of the window. 
The code combines elements of event handling, graphics rendering, and user interaction.
